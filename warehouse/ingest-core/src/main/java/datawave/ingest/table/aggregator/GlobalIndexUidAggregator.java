     * to the day as the timestamp in the global term index. When timestamps are ignored, we cannot infer anything about the order of values under aggregation.
     * Therefore, a decision must be made about how to handle removed UIDs vs added UIDs. In that case, removed UIDs take priority. This means that adding a
     * UID, then removing it, and adding it back again is not a supported operation. When timestamps are not ignored, then it is assumed that the timestamps are
     * set properly and values will be processed in order from newest to oldest. In that case, it is possible to add a UID, then remove it, and add it back
