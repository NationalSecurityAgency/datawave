/**
 * An interface that allows nested iterators (such as ANDs, and ORs) to return references to their leaf nodes. NestedIterators can be visualized as a tree. The
 * top level NestedIterator forms the root, and its children form the next layer all the way down to the leaf nodes. During normal evaluation all leaf nodes are
 * initialized and then candidates bubble up to the root node. When a NestedIterator requires context it cannot be independently evaluated, but requires outside
 * context for its evaluation. This is most often the case when checking for the absence of a specific value. While checking for a specific value is quick,
 * checking against all values that aren't the specific value without context would equate to a near full table scan (both things that aren't that value or just
 * don't have that field). By providing a context of a specific candidate to be tested, the lookup becomes tractable.
