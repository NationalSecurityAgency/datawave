    /**
     * Lists the "effective" Accumulo user authorizations for the calling user. These are authorizations that are returned by the authorization service
     * (possibly mapped to different values, or additional values added for Accumulo compatibility) intersected with the authorizations of the user that is used
     * to connect to Accumulo. The authorizations returned by the call can be passed to query calls in order to return the maximum amount of data the user is
     * authorized to see. Or, authorizations can be removed from this list to downgrade a query.
     * <p>
     * <strong>WARNING:</strong> If this call is made by a server proxying for a user (and/or other servers) then the response will contain multiple
     * authorizations lists--one per entity. It is up to the caller to decide how to combine them if they wish to present a list to the user for downgrading.
     * Note that {@link AuthorizationsListBase#getAllAuths()}, due to recent changes, actually returns only the user's authorizations. That is, these are the
     * authorizations for the calling or proxied entity that represents a human, otherwise, the calling entity's authorizations. This list is sufficient for use
     * in downgrading, but it should be noted the list is not necessarily representative of data that will be returned from a query. When evaluating data for
     * return to a called, the data is tested against every authorization set listed here, and it must pass all of them to be returned. Therefore, if the user
     * has the authorization FOO, but one of the other proxied entities in the chain does not, no data with FOO will be returned even though
     * listEffectiveAuthorizations indicates the user has that authorization.
     * <p>
     * An example scenario where this comes into play is an external person querying through an internal server. The external party will have an authorization
     * for their organization, say EXT1 for example, whereas the server will have the INT authorization. We want to be able to return data with releasabilities
     * such as {@code INT&EXT1}, {@code INT&ALL_EXT}, but not data such as {@code INT&EXT2}. There is no single merged list of authorizations that will allow
     * the correct data to come back. So, instead we test all data against each authorization set. For the {@code INT&EXT2} data example, the server's
     * authorizations will allow the data to be returned since the server has INT. The user's authorizations will not allow the data to be returned however
     * since the user has neither INT nor EXT2. In this scenario, the result for {@link AuthorizationsListBase#getAllAuths()} will contain both INT and EXT1
     * even though the user does not have INT. The INT auth must be passed when queries are created, else no data would be returned (since the INT auth would be
     * removed from the server's auths and then no data would be returned).
     * <p>
     * For most use cases, a GUI can compute the intersection of all authorizations that are not domains and then include the union of organizations. This will
     * not always be the case, however. Consider data marked with something like: {@code FOO&INT|FOO&EXT}. If a system needs to support querying data such as
     * that, then a simple intersection of everything except organization will no longer work.
     * <p>
     * Note that the the return type can be changed by specifying an Accept header, or by adding a suffix to the request URL. The following suffix to return
     * type mppings are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>txt: text/plain
     * <li>xml: application/xml
     * <li>json: application/json
     * </ul>
     * For example, the URL
     *
     * <pre>
     * &lt;baseURL&gt;/User/listEffectiveAuthorizations.json
     * </pre>
     *
     * will return the results in JSON format.
     *
     * @param includeRemoteServices
     *            An optional query parameter to include any remote service operations in the response. Defaults to true.
     * @return the user and proxied entities' authorizations
